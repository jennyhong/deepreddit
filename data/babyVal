communism	1388600398	2qolz	ceeurff	ceeu71y	cave_rat	2	ceeurff	1u5fod	<EOS> com <EOS> morales i understand that you are very upset that someone on the internet does n't agree with your policies and your vision of socialism but i believe that com <EOS> james petras gives valid criticism <EOS> if you actually read his article you will see that he aknowledges the achievements of bolivia under morales compared to his neo-liberal predecessors praises his anti-imperialist foreign policy and vigorous defence of bolivian national sovereignty and at the same time petras has to conclude that bolivia under morales does n't really move to socialism it remains within capitalist framework and the plight of the poor did n't change that much they still remain an exploited class while the country is reigned by the same old oligarchy <EOS>
communism	1393653926	2qolz	cfrkbj3	cfrir60	Fidelis_Guevara	6	cfrkbj3	1z80tp	<EOS> as i said in my other comment a lot of us apologists argue that crimean tatars the natives of crimea do n't want to join the russians <EOS> however crimea has been a majority russian since even before the russian revolution <EOS> it is incredibly likely they want to be part of russia as at least 80 of crimea is not tatar but russian <EOS>
communism	1393654082	2qolz	cfrkd0p	1z87c6	Fidelis_Guevara	2	cfrkd0p	1z87c6	<EOS> thank you for this <EOS> could somebody explain their stance on 2008 georgia <EOS> i was under the impression that south ossetia has a treaty with russia for protection and it was a legal intervention by russia to protect allies <EOS> i am likely wrong though <EOS>
communism	1393662505	2qolz	cfrm7c7	cfrir60	Colbey_uk	-1	cfrm7c7	1z80tp	<EOS> i lurk around here too scared to comment <EOS> but i have to say that this comment is rubbish <EOS> crimea is part of the ukraine like florida is to the us or cornwall is to the uk <EOS> if one part of the ukraine wants to split from the other then that is an internal matter <EOS> there should be no outside forces especially military forcing the issue <EOS>
communism	1393662546	2qolz	cfrm7kf	1z80tp	cave_rat	8	cfrm7kf	1z80tp	<EOS> i do n't believe the reports about russian troops in crimea yet <EOS> it is true that the peninsula is mostly populated by russians and many of them want to secede but it would be wrong to support this on the basis on self-determination in fact this is a classic case of inter-imperialist rivalry <EOS>
