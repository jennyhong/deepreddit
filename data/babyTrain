communism	1388536963	2qolz	ceegnqn	1u3mh5	brown_eggs	2	ceegnqn	1u3mh5	<EOS> nice article <EOS> one thing that was kind of hinted at and i think is also good to point out is that a raise of minimum wage would in many cases not even help the segments of the population that proponents of higher minimum wage like to point to when making their case <EOS> for those struggling to attain basic necessities is the problem really that the minimum wage is too low or is it that the capitalist system is incapable of remedying their concerns <EOS> for the segments of the population who are chronically unemployed underemployed a raise in minimum wage will do almost nothing <EOS> you know maybe instead of making 3,000 a year a poor <SPECIAL> we comrade would make 4,000 <EOS> so really raising the minimum wage would only help the petty bourgeoisie <EOS> on the other hand building dual power in the oppressed nations is really in the objective interest of a fair number of people so let s work toward that <EOS>

communism	1393642081	2qolz	cfrgf6y	1z8g4t	crackerdawg1	2	cfrgf6y	1z8g4t	<EOS> to me it just seems like obama is trying to justify fascism through national self-determination and in the process threatening war <EOS> not too surprising <EOS>
communism	1393648697	2qolz	cfrir60	1z80tp	benevolentsquirrel	13	cfrir60	1z80tp	<EOS> it s highly likely that an overwhelming majority of people in the crimea would prefer to be part of russia <EOS> to call the russian forces occupation-troops would thus be a misnomer <EOS> the core of this issue is not only the overthrowing of an elected gov't but the question of nationalism at what point do a group of people province or area of a country have the right to secede and the right to self-determination <EOS>

communism	1398909754	2qolz	ch6iyga	24eufu	solistus	5	ch6iyga	24eufu	<EOS> i m by no means an expert in either organization so take all of this with a grain of salt the easy issue first the relationship between ycl and cpusa <EOS> the ycl constitution recognizes the cpusa as the political party of the socialism in our country and mentions being intellectually and ideologically guided by the party and cooperating with it <EOS> as far as i know ycl was founded independently and is not strictly speaking a division of cpusa but more or less acts like one <EOS> the ycl like cpusa is very revisionist/leftcom in their ideology <EOS> they call themselves bill of rights socialists meaning they want to preserve the bill of rights and amend it to include rights like housing and employment <EOS> the chairman sam webb is a big fan of market socialism wants to improve rather than demolish the bourgeois state does not view the cpusa as a vanguard party that will lead the proletarian state and celebrated obama s election as a serious setback for neo-liberalism lol <EOS> while i do n't agree with everything this author says here s a pretty good summary of some of the major criticisms of the cpusa from an orthodox marxist-leninist <EOS>
communism	1398910731	2qolz	ch6jf1x	ch5lzam	NewSDS	1	ch6jf1x	2492pp	<EOS> absolutely good question <EOS> that was actually a theme that almost every speaker at the rally talked about <EOS> i think one of the quotes in the article linked above summed it up very well only a united front against the 1 can defeat bigotry and win a better future for our children <EOS>
communism	1398911394	2qolz	ch6jqfc	24eufu	yeahnothx	1	ch6jqfc	24eufu	<EOS> there are sometimes advantages to joining groups of like minded people <EOS> but there are always disadvantages in the us to joining communist ones even in your youth <EOS> be aware that joining the communist party can still have strong negative effects in the future affecting your ability to take some jobs and can be used against you in character trials and only if someone had it out for you already to prevent you from obtaining a passport <EOS> i am a communist just take this advice to be cautious <EOS>
communism	1398912632	2qolz	ch6kaw5	24eufu	brown_eggs	2	ch6kaw5	24eufu	<EOS> though your experience may vary people i know in the ycl have said that the organization tends not to enforce a very strict commitment to the party line so there are marxists of many different shades in the organization <EOS> having said that there are obviously going to be limitations to what you can do within the ycl for reasons already mentioned here <EOS> my understanding is that the ycl has resources though so there are certain advantages to that <EOS> personally if i were recommending something for young people to get involved in the ycl would not at all be my first recommendation <EOS> however one thing to consider is that because even the larger communist parties in the west are pretty small in the grand scheme of things and are still very much in need of cadres in order to be most useful to the more serious organizations it is definitely recommendable to have a good command of theory and at least some practical experience before joining <EOS> experience in the ycl may provide you with that backbone but i m not sure and as i said it would not be my first recommendation <EOS> unfortunately at this time in the u.s the extent to which more serious communists work with youth is somewhat small in my mind in equal parts because of a lack of resources and because of poor priorities <EOS> hopefully that will change <EOS> until then i would recommend keeping an open mind and looking around at more groups than just the ycl <EOS> as far as building a command of theory goes you may be able to take the initiative on this yourself <EOS> this forum and communism 101 are both good resources <EOS> edit also as someone already mentioned security concerns are important <EOS> it is much preferable to join an organization that has some kind of security culture and in particular has its members use pseudonyms <EOS>
